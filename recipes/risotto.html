       <p> Delicious vegeterian italian recipe</p>
       <p>Creamy dish</p>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>3 1/2 cups homemade vegetables stock</li>
           <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
           <li>2 cups risotto rice</li>
           <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
           <li>2 ounces dried porcini mushrooms</li>
      <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano </li>
      <li>Chopped parsley</li>
      <li>Sea salt</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
           
              <li>Prepare a simple vegetables stock by simmering vegetables. Leave the vegetables stock simmering on the stove.</li>
               <li>Submerge and soak the dried porcini mushrooms in a bowl of water for about 30 minutes.            </li>
               <li>In a large pot, sauté the chopped onion in olive oil until it is transparent but not browned. Add all the rice to the pot, stirring with a wooden spoon until the rice is well-toasted. After the rice is toasted add the wine. Attenzione! Be prepared for an intense reaction as the wine evaporates.</li>
<li>After the white wine has evaporated, slowly ladle in 1 spoonful of boiling-hot vegetables stock. Continue to stir with the wooden spoon. Continue in this way, adding 1 ladle of chicken stock and stirring until the liquid has been absorbed. Don’t stop stirring! When the rice is about halfway cooked, drain the porcini mushrooms and add them to the rice.
</li>
<li>Add sea salt to taste. You know the rice is done when it is cooked, but still al dente. While there is still some liquid in the pot, turn off the flame, add the Parmigiano-Reggiano, stir and cover the pot with the lid for 2 minutes. Stir in the parsley and serve.</li>
            </ol>
